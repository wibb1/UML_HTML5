#Description
This site was to complete the HTML5 course that I took through UMASS Lowell.  The requirements set forth for the assignment are detailed below.

# FINAL PROJECT
(updated May 1, 2019)
Your Final Project, which accounts for 25% of your Total Grade, will be a fully functioning Website!

Based on the Lessons that you will complete in the text book, you will supply the HTML code for a functioning website of at least six pages. The subject can be of anything you choose; sports team, restaurant, photography, small business, hobby, school, personal life ... anything!
Don't spend too much time with design work, color themes, etc.; this is an HTML class, not a web design class; all six pages need not be related, as long as all the functions work.

As I previously mentioned, the first several Lessons will give you a working 6-page website ... you don’t need to re-invent the wheel ... most code used today is recycled ... so use that as your base/template, and then make the pages your own with different subject matter, colors, , etc.
One final request: keep the audio/video files short ... I don’t need to watch a three-hour adaptation of War & Peace; I just need to see that you know how to insert it. I don’t want to wait five to ten minutes for you project to download; try to keep it under 50MB!
