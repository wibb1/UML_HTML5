              Service is hard to come by these days but the service that Susie
              and her husband provided me was fantastic. Susie came to my house
              and talked about size, style, color and made sure that what I was
              thinking fit into our space.
              <strong><em>And boy does it ever!</em></strong> In an afternoon we
              were able to put the design I saw in my head on paper, improve my
              vision with a little help from Susie, and she and her husband made
              sure I was involved the entire way.

              I can't say enough about the service that we recieved. Between the
              time that Susie spent with me and the pictures that her husband
              sent during while making the sign it was a fantastic experience. I
              had a say in every choice that was made, a true custom job, and I
              have something I will be proud to have in my home for years.

          <p>
            Working with Sarah Johnson, we designed this sign for her cabin in
            Vermont. She wanted a sign that guests would notice when coming down
            the road to her secluded gravel driveway but not spoil the drive for
            others. She loved her sign and we loved working with her.
          </p>

          <h3>The Huntleys</h3>

          <img src="images/Huntleys.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="130" />

          <p>
            Longtime friends of ours, the Huntleys we one of our first customers.
            They came back to us in 2019 when they wanted a sign made from some
            of the wood harvested from their property in New Hampshire. We were
            happy to help! The wood was rough sawn when it came in but we were
            able to producte a great piece of art for them to hang at the house
            in Massachusetts.
