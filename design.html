            This painting pallet is here for you. Feel free to fiddle with it
            and get a better understanding of what you may want for your sign.
            Obviously we will work with you on colors, styles and textures, but
            this gives you an oportunity to fiddle if you don't have a design
            already.

          <h3>The Johnsons</h3>

          <img
            src="images/Johnsons.jpg"
            width="235"
            height="130"

          />

          <p>
            Working with Sarah Johnson, we designed this sign for her cabin in
            Vermont. She wanted a sign that guests would notice when coming down
            the road to her secluded gravel driveway but not spoil the drive for
            others. She loved her sign and we loved working with her.
          </p>

          <h3>The Huntleys</h3>

          <img src="images/Huntleys.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="130" />

          <p>
            Longtime friends of ours, the Huntleys we one of our first
            customers. They came back to us in 2019 when they wanted a sign made
            from some of the wood harvested from their property in New
            Hampshire. We were happy to help! The wood was rough sawn when it
            came in but we were able to producte a great piece of art for them
            to hang at the house in Massachusetts.
