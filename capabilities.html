          <h2>Our mission statement</h2>

          <h2>Equipment Capabilities</h2>

          <h3>Traditional WoodWorking</h3>

          <p>
            We are capable of many things, traditional woodworking techniques
            from hand tooling to power equipment are definitely in our line of
            duty. If you would like a truely hand crafted masterpiece we can do
            that. There are many techniques that cannot be reproduced by the
            available shop equipment, even in a well equiped shop like ours. We
            will work with you to get the most cost effective method without
            breaking your budget.
          </p>

          var playPause = document.getElementById("playPause");
    

          function setPlayPause(e) {
            if (video.paused) {
              playPause.value = "Play";
              playPause.onclick = function (e) {
                video.play();
              };
            } else {
              playPause.value = "Pause";
              playPause.onclick = function (e) {
                video.pause();
              };
            }
          }

          <h3>Laser Engraving</h3>

          <p>
            The technique of laser engraving brings many new abilites to a sign
            shop. The ability to engrave a photograph, like in the video below,
            is one of the more impressive.
          </p>

          <h3>CNC Routing</h3>

          <p>
            CNC routing has been around for a long time, but the recent movement
            in the industry toward smaller equipment has brouhgt big changes to
            Susie's Signs. The repeatability and ability to make each side
            identicle appeals to people who would like to have many of the same
            signs made or would like to have carving that the cost of a handmade
            sign becomes exorbitant.

          <h3>The Johnsons</h3>

            width="235"
            height="130"
            alt="FunkyOrange Smoothie"
          />

          <p>
            Working with Sarah Johnson, we designed this sign for her cabin in
            Vermont. She wanted a sign that guests would notice when coming down
            the road to her secluded gravel driveway but not spoil the drive for
            others. She loved her sign and we loved working with her.
          </p>

          <h3>The Huntleys</h3>

          <img src="images/Huntleys.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="130" />

          <p>
            Longtime friends of ours, the Huntleys were one of our first
            customers. They came back to us in 2019 when they wanted a sign made
            from some of the wood harvested from their property in New
            Hampshire. We were happy to help! The wood was rough sawn when it
            came in but we were able to produce a great piece of art for them to
            hang at their house in Massachusetts.
